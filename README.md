# Camera Angulara
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/camera-angulara.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/camera-angulara)

Camera Angulara (inspired by the term _camera obscura_) is an Angular 4+ camera module that allows for pictures
to be taken, uploaded with a lot of customizable settings. It uses different browser's native `getUserMedia()` methods
to get the video from the web-camera meaning that this does not have a flash dependency like a lot of the other camera
libraries in JavaScript. This being said, this is not compatible with pre-HTML5 browsers.
